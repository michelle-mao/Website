<h5>I am a physician with a passion for education, data, and art. After attending TAMS from 2015 to 2017, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with a BS in Human Biology and a minor in Spanish. I earned my MD from UT Southwestern Medical Center in 2024, and then completed one year of neurology residency at the University of Maryland before pivoting to a nonclinical career. This website serves as a portfolio for my projects related to my many interests. Outside of work, I enjoy making art, spending time outdoors, and exploring new places with friends.</h5>
