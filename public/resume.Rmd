### About Me

##### I am an incoming MS1 at UT Southwestern. After attending TAMS from 2015 to 2017, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2020 with a BS in Human Biology and a minor in Spanish. This website serves as a portfolio for my projects where I use R to analyze data that interests me. I am also interested in linguistics and worked with stroke and TBI survivors at Austin Speech Labs on their language recovery. Outside of academics, I enjoy making art, reading, playing violin/piano, and spending time outdoors.
